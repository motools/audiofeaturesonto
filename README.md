The Audio Features Ontology
======================================

About
-----

The [Audio Features Ontology](http://purl.org/ontology/af/) expresses some common concepts to represent some features of audio signals. It mainly relies on the Event ontology, in order to classify particular parts of the timeline backing an audio signal. It also supports dense features, such as chromagrams, onset detection function etc.
